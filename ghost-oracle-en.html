                <span class="character-info">Brief description of the character:</span> Since childhood, she was the daughter of her father, who was always proud of her and admired her intelligence and beauty, which surpassed all her peers from the children of the royal family and the nobles. She was of high morals and knowledge. Almost most of the languages of the world, he was a living dictionary, and she was an unparalleled reader, and she was an eloquent poet, so no one could match her, and her mother was very proud of her. The girl was shattered like glass, but she was sane, as she was aware of what his father was doing, and she was trying to stop him, but no one could stop him, because she knew that he was injured in that battle that killed her mother, with a poison that makes those who carry him mad, but her father was resisting the poison, and this is what made him She believes that she is able to heal him, so she imprisoned Nagsa in the library after her father's behavior became more unruly, but she only woke up to her father and his guards storming the library to force him to leave, along with his guardians from the royal family and the royal guards, but the expert spectrum was present in secret, ready to pounce on his father After her departure and those with her, but she was carrying a device that enabled her to monitor the library, she escaped everything that happened, then saw the poison coming out of his father’s mouth while he was about to die, to see her father crying and screaming with all his might and saying what did he do to my people, what did he do, and if the expert spectrum reassures him And he says to him, “You have made the survivors of our family join your daughter. They will go to a safer place, far from that revolution.” Then he gives his sword to her father and says to him, “Now take revenge, for I do not desire a world that my brothers left.” So her father threw the sword on the ground and told him, “Don’t be a fool.” What makes me angry with you is why you didn't kill me before, O Righteous One. You left me digging a hole in hell with my own hands. So lead the revolutionaries and be the ruler who leads our people to glories again, and be careful to save our country from annihilation. She does not need anyone to take care of her, as she is the strongest of our people and the most wise of them. Then he fell in the hands of the expert spectrum and said to him, forgive me, my brother, for I left you with me. And he said to him, "If you see my daughter, tell her that her father did not love anyone as much as he loved your mother, so why did you come into this world? I love you as I love her, and my mother loved you as much as I love him." She sees her father's face for the last time
