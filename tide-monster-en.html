                <span class="character-info">A brief description of the character:</span> tide monster was born in difficult circumstances, as his father's first wife was the enemy of his father, and his mother and father were in conflict with opponents The peace treaty in the army, but days after his birth, everyone began to notice what he was guessing. He was born affected by the old blue wave of his mother and the new one of his father. After a week, the doctors decided that he was able to receive the blue blood system, and in several months he had grown rapidly as a result of a mistake in the experiment The first, which was cast on his mother alone, and so the boy was a cape full of love for his people. He learned the art of hand-to-hand combat and hunting, so he was very strong, stronger than his father and mother, so he became a feared warrior in the course of only one year, but he had a great defect, as he did not want to be a cause of bloodshed. He did not fight the revolutionaries who were in the kingdom so as not to lose more of his people, whether his soldiers or supporters, even his opponents, and this matter began after he returned to his city covered in the blood of his father’s first wife’s followers, then he attacked the capital and killed more of them in the capital with his bare hands until the matter was settled and he went to the palace and did not No one dares to stop him from what they saw of what he did to the soldiers who dumped him before, as he is covered in their limbs and their blood is dripping from his armor, but imagine that he will find everyone from the palace welcoming him and that his stepmother will beg for mercy, but he considers everyone enemy and friend, even the soldiers who They were walking behind him, he saw a look of unparalleled terror and fear, and everyone kneeled in front of him out of fear, and his stepmother was sure that he would amuse him as he did by following her, so she would stab herself with a dagger, and if he stormed the room and his eyes looked at them with wonder, and he was sad like no other, and here he is around He stabbed herself, so he prevented him himself, and told her, "Because I do something for you, I will not kill my stepmother." And she screamed in terror. His mind was gone from terror, so he exiled him to a special place for treatment and detention away from the capital. Everyone who remained alive followed him, and here he swore not to carry any more blood. On his shoulder even if he loses the whole kingdom and even his life itself            </p>
