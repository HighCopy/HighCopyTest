His cousin used to brag about his ability to control weapons and that he had golden blood when he was young, while she did not. Even at one time he deliberately did this in front of the family in a gathering of her father, his mother, his father, his mother, and his older sister, so she felt very angry, and his older sister was laughing in great sarcasm, so she shouted at him and said, “I can do better.” He snapped at her the swords of the guards around him. As if they were forming wings, and pieces of their shields were attached to him, so that a shield would be around her body. Here, the king discovered that his daughter was the first to be born carrying golden blood with him from birth, but his gesture could not fight despite his great capabilities. And here his cousin appeared to kill that killer before he disappeared again and took her to hide her in a hidden room behind the walls and remained outside to protect him. He was teasing her because he loved her with all his heart. Despite his young age, he was proficient in everything, and in fighting he used to use the strongest of the young men, but he finished. just a kid
