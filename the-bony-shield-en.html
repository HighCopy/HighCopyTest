                <span class="character-info">Brief description of the character:</span> A fighter who does not break dust in the battle, so no one equals him except that he was not a father 
                He was like him, and his happiest moment was when one of his sons outperformed him, but because of that, his two sons were suicidal like him, but it was not for them.
                His experience was a battle that raised the dead. It is a cemetery for most of his sons, and this is what made his heart break, so he was walking on the roads among crowds of enemies.
                Like a madman, he tears them apart without mercy, until he used one of the cannons to shoot himself in the air, and he managed to kill more than a hundred fighters while he was
                In the air, including the commander of that army, and one of the enemies attacked him with explosives that threw him into the palace, to find enemy soldiers storming the palace
                And all the guards are dead, so he attacked them with everything he had until he eliminated most of them, but his injury became critical and he was no longer able to stand and led him
                The battle is for one of the people of the hidden palace to hear the sound of a child crying from behind the walls, and there is no way, so he smashed the walls without caring and found
                Lotus, the youngest daughter of the king, so he embraced her as if he were his own daughter, and he wept as if he found his dead children who had come back to life, so he gathered his strength
                And he began to move to help the remaining residents, as the evacuation took place while he was embracing a lotus and jumped out of one of the windows of the palace to find that there was a group
                From the guards defending the lobby of the palace with all their might, they fought with them, so they told him to use the communication devices, so protect the rest of us, and he went to help
                In evacuation, and he feels his confinement like no other, and tears are almost flowing out of grief. Whoever spoke to him on the outburst of communication is his eldest son.
