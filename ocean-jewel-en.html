She is the focus of events until his uncle died and left behind him a young boy who was half her age And he needed care, so she took care of him, so he used to sing a lot of songs for him specially, which made him love to play for her, until that child turned into a young man loved by everyone, even the king saw him as the next king, and he was impressing everyone, so he learned many martial arts and He was studying hard, and this began to spoil the relationship between them, so she began to hate him because she saw that he had stolen her place in the hearts of everyone in the kingdom, but what made her hate his cousin when her father began neglecting him and taking care of him, because she was deeply concerned with the water environment and was supervising many projects related to this. The matter was helping many needy families, and her father was always supporting her, and this was making him happy, but this did not happen, but she did not stop doing good, as she liked to see the faces of her people smiling, so that she held a party in honor of the king, but he did not come, and what accomplished the situation is One of the attendees told him that you must compensate us for not attending the king, so let it be with his song, and this is what it was. After that song, everyone was screaming out of happiness at what they heard, and this made him happy. But after returning to the palace, she knew why her father did not come, as he was taking care of his cousin who suddenly fell ill. And I heard him say to him, “You are my son, so do not disgrace me.” You may be from my brother’s lineage, but I am your father. I do not have another son to entrust that kingdom with. Their wedding was sung to the tune of the sad ruler of Al-Awaj, and all the attendees wept with their sadness        </main>
