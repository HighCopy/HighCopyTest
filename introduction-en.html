            The human race, at its inception, was aware of almost all the facts that we do not know anything about now, or at least we do not have confirmed information about them, such as are we alone in this universe, or are we the first to inhabit the earth or not, and since when have we been on this The land and other things, which we have proven that we do not deserve to know, and which with time were either hidden from us or mixed with others, which made the distinction between what is true and what is false unknown.
            At the beginning of the human era on the earth, the earth was at the height of its strength, as it was as if it were either opening its arms to its expected son, so as much as the earth granted us of resources, we used to give it annihilation, and here it was necessary to be punished, as far as the human race reached progress at this time. In communicating with each other or with non-human beings, whether from another dimension or from another planet, and the technology that humans possessed, we do not dream of until now in terms of treatment, construction, and so on.
            As much as we greed for our mother land, as much as we greed for what other beings possessed, but even what some of us possessed and others did not possess. After that, I prepared the glad tidings to the zero point again.
            We see in history from what remains of our ancestors that there is no great civilization except to the extent of its greatness except to the extent that there were huge gaps between it and what follows it, as if history stopped to notice and decide that starting over is a good thing, since history begins with telling the story of the good news from New only in a different way, and as if the above did not exist in the first place except in our imaginations, so who among us now does not see that what is in the First or Second World War is closer to imagination than reality, as if it were just a myth that has nothing to do with our current world, had it not been for the existence of what documents the foolishness that they committed against them We selves because of greed, and here we must make it clear that these historical gaps are not the same as some of them. There is enough war to return the entire human race to zero, so do not remain behind it to a tale like legends and the wreckage of our dreams, and there are some who do not have all this influence.
