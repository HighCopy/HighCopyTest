                <span class="character-info">A brief description of the character:</span>He was the prime judge of the kingdom of beasts for more than seven successive kings by Al-Laith Al-Hakim, until no one remembered his original appearance, or even his face, lineage, or age until everyone was sure of his age exceeding several centuries until he believed that he was immortal or that he possessed a hidden power in some way and But the only one who was not afraid of him or cared for any of this was the wise lion. Since he was young, they were close friends, so that when the lion died, he heard the echo of his cry and his grief, as if he was roaring a lion. Terrifying, as if demons were coming from the world of death, they had come to harvest the heads, but his real strength was in his credibility and wisdom, which is unquestionable, but the night forced him to implement his will if he died, not to seek justice
