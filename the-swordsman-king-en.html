                <span class="character-info">A brief description of the character:</span> In the beginning, he was a king who loved science and knowledge, so that he would encourage his daughter to be his scientist more than to be the queen, and he was like that since childhood, when he was his friends Close associates, royal emeralds, and expert spectrum, were playing. He was reading books, so he would let them draw, and he would go to the library, but he was Daman, and he used to share their time with them in studying, and they shared with him library times. He dazzled him and he loved him so much that he went to his family to appease them in order to marry her, but they refused, then he challenged the head of the family, and he was the eldest brother of the royal emeralds, so the challenge of the flower of the mix was a challenge between the chief of the crystal spectrum and his wife and the king swordsman and the royal emeralds, so either the family accepted this Marriage or the royal emerald returns to her family if the swordsman loses and victory is his ally, but that love that made him a wonderful human being is what made him a beast after the death of the royal emerald, for his greed is not sufficient for anything, for that void inside him cannot be filled, for he has become unjust, killing everyone who opposes him, and he rose He almost annihilated the Crystal Spectra family, and the prisons of his kingdom were filled with those who opposed him. Those who were lucky and were not killed, and the doors of the palace were closed in the face of the subjects. The only thing that remained unchanged was his love for the sons of his family.
