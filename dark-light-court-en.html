            <h1>History Of Monsters</h1>
            <h2>Dark Light Court</h2>

        <main class="chapter-main">
            It is the main court of the kingdom of monsters, as it is one of the strongest systems of justice that the world has seen. In the beginning, it was an ordinary court until the black judge took over.</p>
            The black judge established a pattern of isolation on the judiciary in order to train them in the means of investigation and judgment and their disputes, which led to the reluctance of many people from the judiciary, and here was his opportunity, so he opened the application for the judge’s job to the masses of the people and only the nobles. The matter received a great attack on him, but he was smart and innovative Many plans to manipulate the nobles, which made the king -The wise lion- admire him and take him as a friend and help him complete the matter.</p>
            And the development of the court again because of the truce, where the meeting place between the judges of the world was in its main hall, and under the organization and coincidence of the black judge, and he managed this session well and won the approval of everyone, and this was the start of the court to become an international reputation and with the temporary cessation of war The black judge took the last step, which is the establishment of a hierarchy among the judges, and it is from top to bottom.</p>
            1- A judge who holds a title linked to a color - such as the Red Judge -</p>
            2- A judge who holds the title of the color and the number of his acquisition of this color in terms of time - such as the first red judge, then the second, then the third, and so on -</p>
            3- A judge without a title.</p>
            4- An investigative judge</p>
            And the next development was with Shams al-Wahush taking over the king, where with the flourishing of war and death, the black judge was trying to heal the wounds of war orphans, so he started to sponsor a huge number of war orphans without paying attention to the origin of this orphan, even if he was in a hostile country, and he did not force these orphans to work Certain, but there were privileges for them if they chose to work in the judiciary system, such as specialized studies and physical training at an early age, but they also helped others in providing work and appropriate training, but after the general study for an additional year, they gained more experience to qualify them to confront the world and the transformation of the old court Gradually, it becomes more like a palace over time, to see the long entrance in front of the court. On its sides there are several obelisks with the names of the judges who served the court in various ranks, and you enter to discover that the appearances deceive the sense that from the inside it is closer to the intellectual castle, so you find a section dedicated to libraries and psychological, philosophical and natural studies. And another section for physical training, then a section for the overnight stay, where most of the judges were staying inside, and there were spaces for discussion between judges, and special areas for litigation, and the hungry run either to study, to train, or to work. It is a real beehive in the middle of which is the black judge.
